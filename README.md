# HTML Emails
This repo holds the html for our Email Newsletter. The initial (October) newsletter was first created in Figma with the Marka Email Generator Pluggin. Then the html was exported. The images were uploaded to imgr and linked into the html. The html was then compressed using an [html compressor](https://www.textfixer.com/html/compress-html-compression.php) which removes spaces so that the email fits under gmail's 102KB limit and isn't cutoff. The newsletters from November onward were revised and shortened so they didn't need to be compressd.

## Setup & Usage
You don't need to download anything to view the email html, just view the file with your web browser. 

In order to send the formatted email in gmail in chrome, download the [MailBrother Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/send-mass-mail-%20-html-ins/obngoldljmnnpggbekneikaohbeflbee). Then when you are composing your email, select the arrow next to thee `Send Mass` button, select `Insert HTML` and copy-paster your (compressed) HTML. The html email will show up in the Compose Window and then you can send it.
